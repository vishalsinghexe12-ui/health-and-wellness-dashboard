                            Proper hydration keeps your body functioning efficiently and boosts daily performance.

                            Water is essential for almost every function in the human body. It helps regulate body temperature, supports digestion, transports nutrients, and removes waste through urine and sweat. Staying properly hydrated improves concentration, prevents fatigue, and keeps your skin healthy. Even slight dehydration can lead to headaches, dizziness, and reduced productivity.

                            Drinking enough water daily supports physical performance and muscle recovery. When you exercise, your body loses fluids through sweat, and replenishing them is crucial to maintain energy and endurance. Proper hydration also aids metabolism, which can help in weight management.

                            Experts generally recommend consuming 7–8 glasses of water per day, but individual needs may vary depending on climate, physical activity, and overall health. You can improve hydration habits by carrying a water bottle, setting reminders, or drinking a glass of water before every meal.

                            In addition to water, hydrating foods like watermelon, oranges, cucumbers, and coconut water can also contribute to fluid intake. Making hydration a daily priority leads to better physical and mental well-being.
